#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)
0(n)
This algorithms run time is 0(n) because its a while loop that'll grow at the same rate depending on what n is.

b)
0(log n)
This algorithms run time is 0(log n) because it first takes in a for loop then a while loop where j doubles until it reaches n.
c)
0(n)
This algorithm is linear because the function is called "bunnies" times, so its linear because if bunny was 10 then it'll run the function 10 times as bunnies decrements 1.
